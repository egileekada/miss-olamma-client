          Voting is done in two ways. 50% of your votes are generated from
          online clicks while the remaining 50% is generated from ticket sales.
          First 2 weeks of every voting stage will be ticket sales (which
          amounts to 50%) while the last 2 weeks will be online votes (which
          also amounts to 50%) each voting stage lasts for 4 weeks.
